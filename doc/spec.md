## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Multi-Modal AI Triage with Vitals-Enhanced Severity Scoring
**User Story:**  
As a patient experiencing a medical emergency, I want to input my symptoms through multiple channels (voice, text, images, wearables) and receive an AI-powered severity assessment that combines my reported symptoms with real-time vital signs data, so that I can get the most accurate priority assessment and appropriate care quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- WHEN a patient submits symptoms via text, voice, or image input THEN the system SHALL process the input using a fine-tuned open-source foundation model (e.g., Llama 2 or Mistral) with medical fine-tuning.  
- WHEN the AI processes symptom data THEN the system SHALL return a priority score from 0-10 with confidence intervals and explainable reasoning within 800ms.  
- WHEN vitals data is available from Apple Health, Google Fit, or medical wearables THEN the system SHALL incorporate real-time biometric data (heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, temperature, HRV) as weighted factors in the severity calculation algorithm.  
- WHEN abnormal vital signs are detected (HR >120 or <50, BP >180/110, SpO2 <90%, temp >101.5Â°F) THEN the system SHALL automatically increase the severity score by 1-3 points based on clinical significance.  
- WHEN vital signs trends show deterioration (increasing HR, dropping SpO2, rising temperature) THEN the system SHALL factor trend analysis into the priority calculation.  
- WHEN image data (wounds, rashes, etc.) is provided THEN the system SHALL use an open-source computer vision model (e.g., YOLO or a fine-tuned Vision Transformer) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.  
- IF the priority score is 8 or above (including vitals-based adjustments) THEN the system SHALL immediately flag the case as critical, alert emergency services, and expedite routing.  
- WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL provide triage services in 15+ languages using an open-source translation model.  
- WHEN explaining the severity score THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate how much the wearable vitals data contributed to the final priority assessment.

### Requirement 1.5: Wearable Vitals-Based Priority Enhancement
**User Story:**  
As an emergency medical professional, I want the AI system to use objective vital signs data from wearable devices to enhance the accuracy of symptom-based triage assessments, so that patients with potentially life-threatening conditions are identified even when they may underreport symptoms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- WHEN heart rate data is available THEN the system SHALL apply clinical thresholds (Tachycardia >100 bpm, Bradycardia <60 bpm) to adjust severity scores.  
- WHEN blood pressure readings are present THEN the system SHALL identify hypertensive crisis (>180/120) or hypotension (<90/60) and increase priority accordingly.  
- WHEN oxygen saturation is monitored THEN the system SHALL flag hypoxemia (SpO2 <95%) as a critical finding requiring immediate attention.  
- WHEN body temperature is tracked THEN the system SHALL detect fever patterns and sepsis risk indicators.  
- WHEN heart rate variability is available THEN the system SHALL use HRV patterns to assess autonomic nervous system stress and cardiac risk.  
- WHEN multiple vital signs are abnormal simultaneously THEN the system SHALL apply compound risk scoring with exponential weighting.  
- WHEN vital signs contradict reported symptoms THEN the system SHALL prioritize objective measurements and flag potential patient under-reporting.  
- WHEN wearable data quality is poor or missing THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate reduced confidence in the assessment and recommend manual vital sign collection.

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Dynamic Routing with Predictive Analytics
**User Story:**  
As a patient, I want to see nearby hospitals with real-time capacity information, predictive wait times, and AI-optimized routing recommendations, so that I can get to the most appropriate facility with the shortest wait time and best outcome probability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- WHEN a patient's location is determined THEN the system SHALL query all hospitals within a 50-mile radius using Firebase/Firestore and real-time traffic data.  
- WHEN hospital capacity data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display hospitals on an interactive map with color-coded availability, specialization indicators, and predicted surge levels.  
- WHEN multiple hospitals are available THEN the system SHALL use open-source optimization algorithms and graph neural networks to recommend the optimal hospital based on severity, capacity, travel time, specialist availability, and historical outcome data.  
- WHEN a recommendation is made THEN the system SHALL provide estimated arrival time, current queue position, and predicted treatment start time with 90% accuracy.  
- WHEN traffic or hospital conditions change THEN the system SHALL dynamically re-route patients and send real-time updates.  
- WHEN specialized care is needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize hospitals with relevant departments (cardiology, trauma, pediatrics) and available specialists.

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Capacity Prediction and Surge Detection
**User Story:**  
As a hospital administrator, I want to predict future patient surges and resource shortages with high accuracy, so that I can proactively allocate staff and beds to minimize wait times and improve patient outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- WHEN real-time and historical hospital capacity data is available THEN the system SHALL use open-source time-series forecasting models (e.g., Prophet or LSTM) to predict patient volume, bed occupancy, and staff availability up to 12 hours in advance.  
- WHEN patient inflow data from Open-Health.ai and other sources (e.g., 911 dispatch) is streamed THEN the system SHALL use a machine learning model (e.g., a Gradient Boosting Classifier or LSTM) to detect potential surge conditions with 95% accuracy.  
- WHEN a surge is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically send alerts to hospital administrators and provide AI-generated recommendations for resource allocation (e.g., "activate standby staff," "convert non-critical beds," "reroute incoming ambulances").  
- WHEN external factors (e.g., weather events, public holidays, major events) are analyzed THEN the system SHALL incorporate this data into the predictive model to improve forecasting accuracy.  
- WHEN the hospital enters a "disaster response" state THEN the system SHALL provide a regional overview of hospital capacity and a dynamic load-balancing plan to reroute patients to the most appropriate facilities.
