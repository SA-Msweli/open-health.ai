# Design Document (Open Source AI)

## Overview
**Open-Health.ai** employs a cutting-edge microservices architecture built on a flexible cloud provider, leveraging open-source foundation models, edge computing, and blockchain technology to create a revolutionary emergency healthcare platform. The system is designed for sub-second response times, 99.99% availability, and seamless scalability from MVP to enterprise deployment supporting millions of users.

### Architecture Philosophy:
- **AI-First Design:** Every component leverages AI for optimization and decision-making  
- **Zero-Trust Security:** End-to-end encryption with blockchain-verified consent management  
- **Edge-Cloud Hybrid:** Critical functions run on edge devices with cloud orchestration  
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Real-time processing using Apache Kafka and WebSocket streams  
- **Firebase-Native:** Built on real-time cloud database architecture from the ground up
